#VBA Challenge

## Project Overview
### Using Visual Basic for Applications to analyze and automate an excel stock market dataset. I've been asked to refact the code to uncover the volume and return percentage for green energy companies in 2017 & 2018. 

## Resources
 - Data Source: challenge_starter_code.vbs
 - Software: VBA Excel 16.41

## Summary
### The conclusion proved refacting the VBA script did help it run faster.  
 - The 2017 data script ran faster than the previous worksheet by 0.8 of a second. 
 - The 2018 data script also ran almost a second faster than the previous version.

## Challenge Overview & Summary
### Being able to run the loop once as opposed to numerous times is more efficient, especially as the data sets get larger. The challenge with running the the loop by start to finish, beginning to end is that I am assuming the data is in order. If for some reason the data wasn't in order (the system I downloaded from changed, the person who usually puts the files together left, etc.) my data would be incorrect. 

## Advantages & Disadvantages
### The advantages of refacting the code are it cuts down compute time (especialy for larger files) saves on labor, money and resources. The disadvantages are the time it takes to edit the data. What is the opportunity cost to have an engineer or analyst working on that as opposed to to something else, potentially more valuable?
